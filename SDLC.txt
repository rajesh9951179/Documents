waterfall model
1.requirement analysis ->exact requirement customer nunchi requirement gather
2.system design ->srs->software desing specification document this phase make a design 
3.implementation
4.testing
5.deployment
6.maintaince



it demands systematic , sequential approach 

1.advantages it is very simple and easy to understand and use
2.easy to manage
3.phases are processed & completed at a time
4.requirement are very well understood


disadvantages
1.no working software is produced until late during life cycle 
2.high amount of risk
3.very poor for large project

prototype model
multiple iteration
design 
prototyping
customer evalution
review and upate
then customer satisfy

development
test
maintain

advantages
customer can see steady progess
this is useful when requirement and changing rapidly

disavantages
it is impossible to know how long it will take process
there is no way to know the no of iteration will be requirement

spiral model

it is combination of waterfall and iteration 
each phase in spiral model begin with design goal and end with client rquirement
software develop in sa series in increment releases
one phase release after second phase

advantages
additional functionality or changes can done at later stage
cost estimation becomes easy




very show to customer
after develop

customer requirement gather
